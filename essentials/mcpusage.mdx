## MCP 


> Every endpoint you register with Velocity is automatically exposed as a fully compliant MCP Server. This lets Claude and other MCP-enabled systems query your data natively — no wrappers, no SDKs, just instant context access. You can use the already hosted MCP or run on your own infrastructure.



> Velocity Hosted MCP Endpoint:
https://velocitymcp.dev/mcp


> This endpoint can be directly used in Claude Desktopor any MCP client to fetch structured data, run queries, or manage API actions.



Example: Using an x402 MCP endpoint with Claude SDK


```js


import { connect } from "@anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk";

const mcp = await connect({
  server: "https://velocitymcp.dev/mcp",
});


const tools = await mcp.listTools();
console.log("Available tools:", tools);


Example: Using an x402 MCP endpoint with Claude SDK
import { connect } from "@anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk";

const mcp = await connect({
  server: "https://mcpv100-production.up.railway.app/mcp",
});


const tools = await mcp.listTools();
console.log("Available tools:", tools);


const res = await mcp.invoke("get-data-from-resource-server_by_get_method", {
    ownerwallet: "devs wallet address who registered the endpoint",
    endpoint: "/api/{yourtaghere}",
    privateKey: "private key of the agent wallet"
});

console.log("MCP Response:", res);
This example covers GET based endpoints

// ENSURE AGENT HAS ASSOCIATED TOKEN ACCOUNT FOR USDC ON SOLANA
console.log("MCP Response:", res);
This example covers GET based endpoints




const res = await mcp.invoke("get-data-from-resource-server_by_post_method", {
    ownerwallet: "devs wallet address who registered the endpoint",
    endpoint: "/api",
    privateKey: "private key of the agent wallet",
    body:{"key1":"value1"},
    tag:"endpoint tag here"
});

console.log("MCP Response:", res);
This example covers POST based endpoints


```
