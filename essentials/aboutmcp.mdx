## What it is 



> MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.
> Using MCP, AI applications like Claude or ChatGPT can connect to data sources (e.g. local files, databases), tools (e.g. search engines, calculators) and workflows (e.g. specialized prompts)—enabling them to access key information and perform tasks


### MCP Features


```md

Developers: MCP reduces development time and complexity when building, or integrating with, an AI application or agent.
AI applications or agents: MCP provides access to an ecosystem of data sources, tools and apps which will enhance capabilities and improve the end-user experience.
End-users: MCP results in more capable AI applications or agents which can access your data and take actions on your behalf when necessary.


```


### Velocity powered MCP

```MCP requires  a setup for devs  to enable the protocol```
> Velocity handles it gracefully by abstracting away complexity and auto enabling MCP for your endpoints
